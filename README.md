# VOScroll - VoiceOver navigation in horizontal UIScrollView

Sample exploring VoiceOver navigation among elements which are subviews of a horizontal UIScrollView.

Try navigation in Portrait and Landscape mode.

Upper scroll view is created by adding subviews to a standard UIScrollView. Lower scroll view is similar, but uses a subclass of UIScrollView which implements the UIAccessibilityContainer protocol.

Currently laid out for an iPad.
